# Let's get started

In order to get started you will need to sign up for a couple of different services that we will be using throughout the semester.
## Google Classroom
The first one is [Google Classroom](http://classroom.google.com). You'll need to navigate over to the classroom landing page and add a new classroom and join a new class with the code

Tell me a little bit more about your self and your experience with computers and programming

## p5.js
p5.js is a JavaScript library that we will be using for this class. If you don't know what JavaScript is or what a JS library is, don't worry about it. We'll get the all sorted out as we go. In the mean time, head over to the [p5.js Web Editor](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/signup) and sign up for a new account using your FCS google credentials.

## Reflective Journal
Lastly, take a minute to tell me a little something about your previous experience with computers and coding. Some of you may have already seen this before in 8th grade, but I still want to know how your relationship with coding and computers has changed.
