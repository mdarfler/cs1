## p5.js
p5.js is a JavaScript library that we will be using for this class. If you don't know what JavaScript is or what a JS library is, don't worry about it. We'll get the all sorted out as we go. In the mean time, head over to the [p5.js Web Editor](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/signup) and sign up for a new account using your FCS google credentials.
